<h1>About</h1>

<p>Hello there ðŸ‘‹</p>

<p>
  The "barbajoe" link in the site footer will take you to a list of my recent projects, or you can
  view my <a href="https://rxresu.me/barbajoe/joe-sebast-2024">resume</a> for more details about me and
  what I do, but the short version is that I'm a full stack engineer with a front-end focus.
</p>

<p>
  I am currently a tech lead and am slowly dipping my toes into an architecture role as my manager
  is trying to get me to stretch myself into a higher-level role, which is fun! A bit daunting, but
  there are a lot of great resources out there. Really quickly, Mark Richards <a
    href="https://www.youtube.com/@markrichards5014">YouTube channel</a
  > is excellent. Out of all the resources that I've been exploring, including paid options, his Software
  Architecture Monday series is my favorite.
</p>

<p>
  I'll be using this blog as a journal. I will document what I've found that I want to remember and
  what I've accomplished. I hope that you find it interesting, easy, and helpful. With that said,
  let's get good! ðŸ¥³ ðŸŽ‰
